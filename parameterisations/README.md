# parameterisations

A toolbox for parameter selection for Antarctic melt parameterisations for
the [ISMIP7]() activity

## Documentation

Parameter selection is specified in the documents provided on the [website of the focus group](https://www.ismip.org/participants/focus-groups/ais-basal-melt).

This directory contains the toolbox `parameter_selection_toolbox.py`, which includes functions to help with parameter selection, and examples.

First example is the quadratic parameterisation (quadratic local with mean Antarctic slope as defined in Burgard et al., 2022). Note that here we calculate melt rates independently. In ISMIP7/meltMIP, the melt rate should be calculated through the ice-sheet model code and grid instead. To run this example, please install the multimelt python package (https://pypi.org/project/multimelt/).

Second example is PICO, based on simulations done with PISM-PICO. If you would like access to those, please contact Ronja.

Third example is LADDIE. If you would like access to the data required to run the examples, please contact Erwin.

Fourth example is MALI, in [`mali/`](mali/). It differs from the others in that the melt rates are calculated by the ice-sheet model itself, on its own unstructured, variable-resolution mesh, rather than independently in Python. It calibrates both the local and the semi-local quadratic forms, and includes a mesh-agnostic rewrite of `calculate_term1..4` that takes a cell-area array instead of a scalar resolution, so that the same functions serve structured grids and unstructured meshes. If you would like access to the MALI melt fields, please contact Xylar.

Toolbox:
- `calculate_term1`, `calculate_term2`, `calculate_term3`, `calculate_term4`: calculate the different terms
- `calculate_objective_function`: calculates the optimal parameters specified for a number of samples, with freely chosen weights (see below)
- `optimise_deltaT`: identifies optimal `deltaT` for a given fixed parameter value, used only for PICO

Weights: You are free to adjust the weights of the different terms in the parameterisation, as these are simply inputs into the `objective_function` calculation. Please see the examples on how to do this.

## Data input requirements

Data is available on globus, mainly in:/ISMIP7/AIS/parameterisations/ocean except for datasets used in other components (climatology, topography) which can be found in /ISMIP7/AIS/obs/ocean/.

### 1. Ensemble using present-day observed ocean climatology
The toolbox requires ensemble of modelled melt rates for a range of parameter values. These are given in xarray dataset called pd_ensemble, with parameter values indexing the melt rate field. Parameters are called "p1" and "p2" (if only one parameter set is used, just set p2=1). For example, for PICO p1=C and p2=gammaT; while for the quadratic p1=K, p2=1 (constant). Melt rates are saved in variable called "melt_rate" given in kg/m2/a. Positive values correspond to melting, negative to refreezing. This should contains polar stereographic x and y coordinates.

### 2. "Cold" and "warm" ensembles
Equally, you will need to create a cold and warm ensemble (cold_ensemble, warm_ensemble) for each tuning dataset which are also indexed by p1 and p2 and the model ('mathiot', 'naughten_ais_1',..). They contain corresponding melt rates modelled with your melt module (variable called "melt_rates").
A range of cold and warm ocean states, as well as melt rates from 3D ocean dynamical models are available:
Circum-Antarctic
- Mathiot et al., 2023
- Naughten et al., 2018 (2 simulations)
Amundsen Sea
- Jourdain et al. 2022 (3 simulations)
- Naughten et al., 2023 (10 simulations)
Weddell Sea
- Timmermann and Goeller 2017
- Haid et al., 2023 (3 simulations)
- Naughten et al., 2021 (2 simulations)

Since doing all would be a considerable amount of work, we suggest using 2 circum-Antarctic simulations ("mathiot" and "naughten_ais_1"). However, if modellers want to focus on one particular region, e.g., the Amundsen Sea or the Weddell Sea, we suggest using the corresponding, higher resolution datasets in this case.

### 3. Ensemble using Amundsen Sea observations
You will need to create also an ensemble for observational data (obs_ensemble) for observational datasets from the Amundsen Sea, which are again indexed by p1 and p2, the ice shelf ("pig" or "dotson") and the year of the observation. We provide dataset created from observations on the ismip 8km ocean grid for
- 1994 pig
- 2000 dotson
- 2006 dotson
- 2007 pig, dotson
- 2009 pig, dotson
- 2010 pig
- 2011 dotson
- 2012 pig, dotson
- 2014 pig, dotson
- 2016 pig, dotson
- 2018 dotson
- 2019 pig
- 2020 pig

Again, we suggest using only a subset of the datasets. As Dotson data is more complicated to interpret due to the connection between Dotson and Crosson ice shelves, we suggest using the years 2009 and 2012 for Pine Island.

### 4. Masks
Furthermore, you will need a
- basin mask, available through ismip for the 8km grid (used for observational data), and on your model tuning grid (only regular grids are suported at the moment).
- grounded, floating mask, which is 1 in floating regions/ice shelves and 0 otherwise, again on 8km for data (provided) and on your model tuning grid
- buttressing bins, on 8km for data and on your model tuning grid (provided)
